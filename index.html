                <p>I am very pleased with the printing of the book. Lightning Press was easy to work with and always available. I have recommended your services to a number people who have inquired. The print quality of the illustrations have been a big selling point for the book.

                <p>Working with you and Lightning was a very good experience, as I am sure Beverley and Eloise will agree. Both the Hardcover and Softcover were beautifully printed, high quality products. We have done well with the books and are discussing a re-order.
